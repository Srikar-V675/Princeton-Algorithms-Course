# Algorithms by Princeton University (Coursera)

This repository will contain the implementations, demos, and assignments for the Algorithms course by Princeton University on Coursera. The course covers essential algorithms and data structures, and all content will be implemented in Python.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my work for the Algorithms course by Princeton University on Coursera. It will include Python implementations of various algorithms and data structures, as well as solutions to the course assignments.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into the following modules:

1. **Union-Find**
2. **Analysis of Algorithms**
3. **Stacks and Queues**
4. **Elementary Sorts**
5. **Mergesort**
6. **Quicksort**
7. **Priority Queues**
8. **Elementary Symbol Tables**
9. **Balanced Search Trees**
10. **Hash Tables**
11. **Strings**
12. **Geometric Applications of BSTs**

Each module contains lectures, readings, and assignments to reinforce the concepts.

## Progress

Below is the progress of the modules as I complete them:
